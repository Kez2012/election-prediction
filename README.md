# Predicting Lok Sabha Elections

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that utilizes demographic and political party-related data to forecast the likelihood of a particular candidate winning the Lok Sabha Election which is held once in every 5 years in India. By combining key indicators of voter behavior and electoral patterns, this data-driven approach seeks to enhance the understanding of electoral outcomes and potentially aid in the formulation of effective campaign strategies.

## Objectives:
  1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding demographic and political party features and their impact on past election outcomes to drive insights.   
  2. Prediction Model: Preprocessed data using python packages- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and build a prediction model. Improved model accuracy by implementing 
                         feature engineering and feature selection techniques.     
  3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed the sentiment of tweets made by users regarding the upcoming elections and using NLP techniques classified it as 
                                   positive, neutral and negative to get a better perspective of voters.  


## Outcome:  
The past trends and patterns of election outcomes and candidate demographics were analyzed to better understand the competitive landscape. Prediction model achieved more than 90%+ accuracy by feature engineering and feature selection techniques. The model's ability to predict election results accurately can assist political parties in allocating resources strategically, identifying key demographics to target, and tailoring campaign messages effectively.
