# Predicting Lok Sabha Elections

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that utilizes demographic and political party-related data to forecast the likelihood of a particular candidate winning the Lok Sabha Election which is held once in every 5 years in India. By combining key indicators of voter behavior and electoral patterns, this data-driven approach seeks to enhance the understanding of electoral outcomes and potentially aid in the formulation of effective campaign strategies.

Objectives:  
    1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding demographic and political party features and their impact on past election outcomes to drive insights.   
    2. Prediction Model: Preprocessed data using python packages- scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and build a prediction model. Improved model accuracy by implementing 
                         feature engineering and feature selection techniques.     
    3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed the sentiment of tweets made by users regarding the upcoming elections and using NLP techniques classified it as 
                                   positive, neutral and negative to get a better perspective of voters.
